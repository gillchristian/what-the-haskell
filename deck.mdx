## So, how is Haskell different? 🤔

<small>

_Besides the syntax_ 😅

</small>

---

- Statically typed
- Type inference
- Purely functional
- Immutability
- Lazy

---

## Immutability 🥊

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
let a = 1

a = a + 1
```

</CodeSurfer>

<img src={drakeNo} style={{ width: 350, position: 'fixed', right: '7%', top: '10%', transform: 'rotate(8deg)'}} />

---

## Statically Typed 🤗

<img src={theFeels} style={{ width: 350, position: 'fixed', right: '5%', bottom: '7%', transform: 'rotate(-8deg)'}} />

---

## Everything needs to be typed

### Yeah, JSON as well!

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Jane',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  age: 34,
}

JSON.stringify(user)
```

```ruby
require 'json'

user = {
  'name' => 'Jane',
  'last_name' => 'Doe',
  'age' => 34,
}

user.to_json
```

```haskell
data User = User
  { name :: String,
    last_name :: String,
    age :: Int
  }
```

```haskell
data User = User
  { name :: String,
    last_name :: String,
    age :: Int
  }

instance ToJSON User where
  toJSON u = object
    [ "name"      .= toJSON (name u)
    , "last_name" .= toJSON (last_name u)
    , "age"       .= toJSON (age u)
    ]
```

```haskell
data User = User
  { name :: String,
    last_name :: String,
    age :: Int
  } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)

instance ToJSON User where
  toJSON u = object
    [ "name"      .= toJSON (name u)
    , "last_name" .= toJSON (last_name u)
    , "age"       .= toJSON (age u)
    ]
```

```haskell 1:13
data User = User
  { name :: String,
    last_name :: String,
    age :: Int
  } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)

user = User
  { name = "Jane",
    last_name = "Doe",
    age = 34
  }

encode user
```

### Type Driven Development 🛡️

Make impossible states impossible (to represent)

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

seasonFromString :: String -> Maybe Season
seasonFromString season =
  case season of
    "spring" -> Just Spring
    "summer" -> Just Summer
    "autumn" -> Just Autumn
    "winter" -> Just Winter
    other    -> Nothing
```

```haskell
first :: [a] -> Maybe a
first xs =
  case xs of
    []       -> Nothing
    (x:rest) -> Just x
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Type inference 🕵️‍♀️

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
average :: (Real a, Fractional b) => [a] -> b
average as =
  let total = realToFrac (sum as)
      count = realToFrac (length as)
   in total / count
```

```haskell
average as =
  let total = realToFrac (sum as)
      count = realToFrac (length as)
   in total / count
```

```haskell
GHCi> :t average
average ::
  (Fractional a1, Real a2, Foldable t) => t a2 -> a1
```

```haskell
(Real a2, Fractional a1, Foldable t) => t a2  -> a1
-- vs
(Real a,  Fractional b             ) => [ a ] -> b
```


</CodeSurfer>

### 👀 Example: Type inference errors 👨‍💻

<!-- TODO -->

---

## Lazy evaluation 😴

---

### 👀 Example: Infinite lists 👨‍💻

---

### 👀 Example: if/else function 👨‍💻

---

## Purely functional 😎

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
key = "super-secret-key"

checksum :: ByteString -> ByteString
checksum content = MD5.hash (key <> content)
```

```haskell 1:4
checksum :: ByteString -> ByteString
checksum content = 
  let key = readFile "~/.secrets"
   in MD5.hash (key <> content)
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<small>

```
• Couldn't match type ‘ByteString’ with ‘IO ByteString’
  Expected type: IO ByteString
    Actual type: ByteString
```

</small>

---

### No side effects !!! 😠

<img src={drakeNo} style={{ width: 350, position: 'fixed', right: '7%', top: '10%', transform: 'rotate(8deg)'}} />

---

### No explicit side effects !!! 😎

<img src={drakeYes} style={{ width: 350, position: 'fixed', left: '5%', top: '7%', transform: 'rotate(-8deg)'}} />

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell 1[27:39] title="IO is for side effects"
checksum :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
checksum content = do
  key <- readFile "~/.secrets"
  pure (MD5.hash (key <> content))
```

```haskell title="IO is for side effects"
checksum :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
checksum content = do
  key <- readFile "~/.secrets"
  pure (MD5.hash (key <> content))
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
GHCi> :t readFile
readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
```

```haskell
GHCi> :t getLine
getLine :: IO String
```

```haskell
GHCi> :t putStrLn
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

How's **IO String** different from **String** ?

How to get **String** when I have **IO String** ?

---

### 🌯 Monads (and friends) 🌯

---

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
main = do
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

```haskell 1:5
main =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
    >> (getLine
           >>= (\name ->
                  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")))
```

</CodeSurfer>

There's more

- Applicative
- Foldable / Traversable
- Point-free syntax
- Parsers
- Currying 
- Monad transformers
- Records / Lenses
- Language extensions
- Debugging
